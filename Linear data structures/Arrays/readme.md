# Array:
- Array is a container which can hold a fix number of items and these items should be of the same type.

## Referencial Arrays:
- It's process of storing values in an array of multiple data types. Python list and tuple are also known as referential arrays.
- **Disadvantage:** It's may little slow than **simple array**(which stores same data type values).
- **How it's work:** We store values of different data types in variables separately. Then, we store their memory addresses in an simple array.

## Static Arrays:
- It has fixed size that is determined at the time of declaration. Size does not change during runtime.
- **Disadvantage:** Increase the chance of memory wastage.

## Dynamic Arrays:
- It does not have any fixed size and can be resized as needed. It means it can grow or shrink in size during runtime.
- **Advantage:** Reduce wastage of memory.
