## Linked List
A linked list is a data structure used in computer science for organizing and storing data. Unlike arrays, which store elements in contiguous memory locations, linked lists use nodes to store data and a set of pointers to connect these nodes.

**Here are the basic elements of a Linked List:**
- **Node:** Each element in a linked list is called a node. A node consists of two parts:
    - **Data:** The actual value or information stored in the node.
    - **Next:**  A reference or pointer to the next node in the sequence.
- **Head:** The first node in the linked list is called head. It serves as the entry point for accessing the list/
- **Tail:** The last node in the linked list is called tail. It's 'Next' field points to NULL, which indicates the end of the list.
